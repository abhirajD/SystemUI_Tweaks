SystemUI tweaks and Experiments

Description:
SystemUI is responsible for rendering android's UI. This systemUI has been extracted from Xolo X1000 phone.
I keep on experimenting with it, sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt. 

It may or may not work on your device. So, be carefull before trying out.
